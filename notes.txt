Database side of things:
    Create 2 tables: one for the general information and then one for the history of things (5 attributes 4 hymns all forign keys as well as the date)
    Makes queries  filter by topic and date (must not have been played in at least 3 months*)
    *Change time period as needed

    After the hymns are all selected, create a new entry for the history 


Potential sq query:
SELECT *
FROM hymns
WHERE order = 1
ORDER BY RAND()
LIMIT 1;
